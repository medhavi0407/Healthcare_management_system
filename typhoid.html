<h1>TYPHOID</h1>
<H2>Key Facts</H2>
<ul>
    <li> Typhoid fever is a life-threatening infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. It is usually spread through contaminated food or water.</li>
    <li>An estimated 11â€“20 million people get sick from typhoid and between 128 000 and 161 000 people die from it every year</li>
    <li>Symptoms include prolonged fever, fatigue, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation or diarrhoea. Some patients may have a rash. Severe cases may lead to serious complications or even death.</li>
    <li>Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics although increasing resistance to different types of antibiotics is making treatment more complicated</li>
</ul>
<p>Typhoid fever is a life-threatening infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. It is usually spread through contaminated food or water. Once Salmonella Typhi bacteria are eaten or drunk, they multiply and spread into the bloodstream.</p>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Salmonella Typhi lives only in humans. Persons with typhoid fever carry the bacteria in their bloodstream and intestinal tract. Symptoms include prolonged high fever, fatigue, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation or diarrhoea. Some patients may have a rash. Severe cases may lead to serious complications or even death. Typhoid fever can be confirmed through blood testing.</p>
<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p>Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics. As resistance to antibiotics has emerged including to fluoroquinolones, newer antibiotics such as cephalosporins and azithromycin are used in the affected regions. Resistance to azithromycin has been reported sporadically but it is not common as of yet.</p>
<p>Even when the symptoms go away, people may still be carrying typhoid bacteria, meaning they can spread it to others through their faeces.</p>
<p>It is important for people being treated for typhoid fever to do the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Take prescribed antibiotics for as long as the doctor has prescribed</li>
    <li>Wash their hands with soap and water after using the bathroom, and do not prepare or serve food for other people. This will lower the chance of passing the infection on to someone else.</li>
    <li>Have their doctor test to ensure that no Salmonella Typhi bacteria remain in their body.</li>
</ul>
