<h1>CARDIAC ARREST</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the sudden loss of all heart activity due to an irregular heart rhythm. Breathing stops. The person becomes unconscious. Without immediate treatment, sudden cardiac arrest can lead to death.</p>
<p>Emergency treatment for sudden cardiac arrest includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and shocks to the heart with a device called an automated external defibrillator (AED). Survival is possible with fast, appropriate medical care.</p>
<p>Sudden cardiac arrest isn't the same as a heart attack. A heart attack happens when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked. Sudden cardiac arrest is not due to a blockage. However, a heart attack can cause a change in the heart's electrical activity that leads to sudden cardiac arrest.</p>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Sudden collapse.</li>
    <li>No pulse</li>
    <li>No breathing.</li>
    <li>Loss of consciousness.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes other symptoms occur before sudden cardiac arrest. These might include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Chest discomfort.</li>
    <li>Shortness of breath.</li>
    <li>Weakness.</li>
    <li>Fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart called palpitations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Causes</h2>
<p>A change in the heart's electrical activity causes sudden cardiac arrest. The change makes the heart stop pumping blood. No blood flow goes to the body.</p>
<h3>How the heart beats</h3>
<p>Electric signals in the heart control the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat. Faulty or extra electrical signals can make the heart beat too fast, too slowly or in an uncoordinated way. Changes in the heartbeat are called arrhythmias. Some arrhythmias are brief and harmless. Others can lead to sudden cardiac arrest.</p>
<h3>Heart conditions that can lead to sudden cardiac arrest</h3>
<p>The most common cause of sudden cardiac arrest is an irregular heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation. Rapid, erratic heart signals cause the lower heart chambers to quiver uselessly instead of pumping blood. Certain heart conditions can make you more likely to have this type of heartbeat problem.</p>
<p>Heart conditions that can cause sudden cardiac arrest include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Coronary artery disease. Sudden cardiac arrest may occur if the heart arteries become clogged with cholesterol and other deposits, reducing blood flow to the heart.</li>
    <li>Heart attack. If a heart attack occurs, often as a result of severe coronary artery disease, it can trigger ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac arrest. Also, a heart attack can leave scar tissue in the heart. The scar tissue can cause changes in the heartbeat.</li>
    <li>Enlarged heart called cardiomyopathy. This condition usually happens when the walls in the heart muscle stretch. The heart muscle gets bigger or thicker.</li>
    <li>Heart valve disease. Leaking or narrowing of the heart valves can lead to stretching or thickening of the heart muscle. When the chambers become enlarged or weakened because of stress caused by a tight or leaking valve, there's an increased risk of developing a heart rhythm problem.</li>
