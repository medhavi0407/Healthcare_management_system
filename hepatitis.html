    <h1>Hepatitis B</h1>
    <h2>Why get vaccinated?</h2>
    <p>Hepatitis B vaccine can prevent hepatitis B. Hepatitis B is a liver disease that can cause mild illness lasting a few
        weeks, or it can lead to a serious, lifelong illness.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Acute hepatitis B infection is a short-term illness that can lead to fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea,
            vomiting,
            jaundice (yellow skin or eyes, dark urine, clay-colored bowel movements), and pain in the muscles, joints, and
            stomach.</li>
        <li>Chronic hepatitis B infection is a long-term illness that occurs when the hepatitis B virus remains in a
            personâ€™s body.
            Most people who go on to develop chronic hepatitis B do not have symptoms, but it is still very serious and can
            lead to
            liver damage (cirrhosis), liver cancer, and death. Chronically infected people can spread hepatitis B virus to
            others,
            even if they do not feel or look sick themselves.</li>
